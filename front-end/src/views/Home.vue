      <p class="leading-loose text-lg">Hi, and welcome to my portfolio.
        I am a self-taught software engineer, and a lifelong learner. As a natural problem-solver,
        I’ve always found it natural to seek solutions for problems I’ve encountered.
        In 2019 I started applying these problem solving skills in the software engineering space,
        and never looked back.<br>
        I am currently a full stack software engineer at
        <a href="https://bluewater-fintech.com/" target="_blank">
          Blue Water Financial Technologies
        </a>
        where I enjoy creating solutions for the mortgage servicing industry.
